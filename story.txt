Once upon a time, Ganesha, the god of wisdom and beginnings, was on his way home from a long journey. He was feeling very thirsty and tired, so he decided to stop at a nearby lake for a drink of water.

As he was drinking from the lake, a mischievous little mouse saw him and decided to play a prank on him. The mouse ran up to Ganesha and started nibbling on his trunk, making Ganesha sneeze uncontrollably.

Ganesha was getting increasingly frustrated with the mouse's antics, and he tried to shoo the mouse away. However, the mouse was too quick for him and kept running around him.

Finally, Ganesha had an idea. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a sweet laddoo, a type of Indian sweet. He offered the laddoo to the mouse, hoping to distract it from its mischief.

To his surprise, the mouse loved the laddoo and begged Ganesha for more. Ganesha agreed to give the mouse more laddoos, but only if the mouse promised to be his loyal companion and help him on his journeys.

The mouse agreed, and from that day on, it became Ganesha's trusted companion. Together, they went on many adventures, and the mouse's quick wit and agility proved invaluable to Ganesha.

And that is how Ganesha, the god of wisdom, found a faithful companion in a mischievous little mouse.
